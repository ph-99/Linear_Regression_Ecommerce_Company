# Linear_Regression_Ecommerce_Company
Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions.  
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
Ecommerce Customers csv file from the company has Customer info, suchas Email, Address, and their color Avatar. 
Then it also has numerical value columns:
Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.

Interpreting the coefficients:

Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Avg. Session Length is associated with an increase of 25.98 total dollars spent.
Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Time on App is associated with an increase of 38.59 total dollars spent.
Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Time on Website is associated with an increase of 0.19 total dollars spent.
Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Length of Membership is associated with an increase of 61.27 total dollars spent.

Do you think the company should focus more on their mobile app or on their website?
There are two ways to think about this: 
Develop the Website to catch up to the performance of the mobile app, or develop the app more since that is what is working better. 
This sort of answer really depends on the other factors going on at the company, we would probably want to explore the relationship 
between Length of Membership and the App or the Website before coming to a conclusion.
